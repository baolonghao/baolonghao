- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @baolonghao
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in wave particle interaction in tokamak, 
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning plasma simulation, and published some papers.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on transp, orbit and nova/novak.
- üì´ my email is blhao@ipp.ac.cn, we can talk by zoom meeting.
- Research interests
Fast ion behavior in the toroidally confined plasma, such as beam ions physics simulation in tokamak experiment and alpha particle in fusion reactor design. Have working experience in EAST, CFETR and BEST. 
Have experience of neutral beam injection heating and alpha particle physics.
